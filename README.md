# GLOBAL ECONOMIC DEMOGRAPHIC TRENDS ANALYSIS - POWER BI PROJECT

  This project presents a detailed data analysis and visualization of global economic and demographic trends using datasets from 1960–2016. It combines SQL, Excel, and Power BI to uncover insights about GDP, population, income groups, health indicators, and sector contributions for over 225 countries.

# 📂 Dataset & Structure
* CountriesWorld.sql: Raw SQL data for country-level demographics & economy

* GDP & Population (Excel/CSV): Data from 1960–2016

* Metadata: Country income groups, region classifications

* PBIX File: Final interactive Power BI dashboard

* Presentation & Report: PowerPoint slides and DOCX summary with insights

# 🧠 Project Objectives
 ✅ Analyze GDP and population trends over time
 ✅ Understand country-level differences across income groups and regions
 ✅ Examine health and infrastructure metrics (e.g., literacy, mortality, phones)
 ✅ Identify countries leading and lagging in various economic dimensions

# 🛠️ Tools & Techniques Used
* Power Query: Data cleaning & transformation

* SQL (MySQL): Database creation, structured import

* Excel: Data verification & structure setup

* DAX: Calculated columns (growth rate, per capita metrics)

* Power BI: Dashboard design, interactive visuals, model relationships & link the SQL data to power BI

# 📊 Key Visuals in Dashboard
📈 GDP & Population over time (1960–2016)

🌐 Income group distribution by population

🗺️ Country-wise GDP per capita & population density

📉 Infant mortality & birth/death rate comparisons

📞 Phones per 1000 people, literacy vs GDP analysis

🔢 Sector contributions: Agriculture, Industry, Service

# 🔍 Key Insights
📈 Global GDP grew from $1T to $72T; population rose from 2.7B to 6.6B

🌍 Lower-middle income nations house the largest population share

**🇺🇸** USA leads in total GDP ($386T); China tops in population

**🇱🇺** Luxembourg has highest GDP per capita; Somalia & Sierra Leone among lowest

📉 Infant mortality is declining globally, indicating improved healthcare

📊 Strong correlation between GDP growth and population growth over decades

# 🔗 Project Highlights
